Cee-lo javascript

Cee-lo is a classic dice game

typically played with 3 dice

in this version the user will play against the computer at first

in subsequent editions, you will be able to add up to 4 players, computer or user controlled

to "get on board" in cee-lo you must roll your die simultaneously and have 2 of them match. your points scored would be equal to the value on the third dice

should you have all three dice match in value this would automatically supersede any roll where just 2 dice match. the only way to score higher than a roll with three matching dice is to have three matching dice of higher value or a roll of "4,5,6"

rolling "4,5,6" with your three dice is referred to as "headcrack" or "ace" snd is counted as an automatic win, even if other players in the cycle have not rolled yet
